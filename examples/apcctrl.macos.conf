# Sample apcctrl.conf for macOS
# Choose ONE of the two blocks below according to your UPS connection.

# --- USB/HID (recommended default) ---
UPSTYPE usb
DEVICE
LOCKFILE /tmp/apcctrl.lock
NETSERVER on
NISPORT 3551
# NISIP 0.0.0.0   # uncomment to listen on all interfaces (usually not needed)

# --- Serial/apcsmart (if your device enumerates as tty/cu modem) ---
# UPSTYPE apcsmart
# DEVICE /dev/cu.usbmodem14201
# LOCKFILE /tmp/apcctrl.lock
# NETSERVER on
# NISPORT 3551

# Notes:
# - For UPSTYPE usb, leave DEVICE empty so HID auto-detect works.
# - Use /tmp for LOCKFILE on macOS to avoid permission issues.
# - Ensure no other apcctrl instance is running when testing foreground mode.
